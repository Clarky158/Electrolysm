Note to Clarky158 : I will make a deal with you; you can put in 'The basics' if it does not count 
as a research and to also delete the micraft forms page so i can make one, this means i take
over on that sutff so you can focus on coding/ textures.

Note to Ellio98: Firstly CHECK YOUR SPELLING!! Second you can also add the crafting as I don't have the time to add
everything, it would take twice as long. Also why do i have to make a crusher, it's already been added... Or have you
broke it.
P.S I have fixed you spelling mistakes, but if future please check!!
