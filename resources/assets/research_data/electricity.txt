You have just dicovered some kind of energy #and decided to call Electricity.you #have also decided that electricity should be measured #in Tesla Energy Units, after the famous #electrical engineer, Nikola Tesla. You have #found that the burning of fuels can be used #to produce these Tesla Units, and the #Tesla Units can be used to power machines.# But unfortuneitly electricty is useless without #a way of sotring it, but your sure #with research you will solve this. Also another #issue is that your #generators are not very powerful or efficiant, so #you hope to improve this with research.
