You have found that energised crystals can #store electrical energy. However they can #only stand a specific amount of Amps. You #have also discovered that the more machines #and generators you have attached to the #Core the creater the Ampage in the becomes. #There must be at least one Energy Core in #each power network you create, as neither #generators nor machines can store power #internaly.
