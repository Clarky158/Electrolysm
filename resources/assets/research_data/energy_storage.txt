You have found that energised crystals can #store electrical energy,unfortuneitly not alot of energy, but your #sure with more research you can impropve this. #However they can only stand a specific #amount of Amps. You have also discovered that the #more machines and generators you have attached #to the Core the greater the Ampage #comes. And the higher the Ampage the more energy #lost per tick, you hope to one day solve this issue#There must be at least one Energy Core in #each power network you create, as neither #generators nor machines can store power #internaly.
