Before you begin you quest to discover and utilise your scientific mind, you need to learn information about the scientific make up of everything inside this universe. To do this you require a "scanner" (new name required) By right clicking a block multiple times, you will learn about the chemical structure of it. To learn and discover new things, you will have to earn knowledge in specific fields. On par with this, different projects require different amounts of knowledge; similarly to these different projects require different blocks and items to have been discovered. Overall I wish you luck in gaining scientific know-how, and becoming the best scientist you can.
