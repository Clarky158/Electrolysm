You have found, though your travels that #lava or magma is extremily hot, and may kill. So you have #developed a way to utilise this energy. #This new lava using generator, is by far #your best generator and can produce 42 #TeU per tick. However it must be constantly #fed with lava for it to function correctly, and# it also loses alot of heat, but you hope with# research you can solve this.
