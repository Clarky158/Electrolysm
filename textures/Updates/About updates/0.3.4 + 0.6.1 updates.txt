====================
0.3.4 Update
====================

new texture to einstienium

new ore gen
ores drop dust so no smelting required
>lead
>silver
>tin
>copper

config file for world gen

New machines
>solar collector
>matter synthesiser

matter sythisiser
makes matter from diamons
requires sollar collector on side
(for crafting see pictures)

sollar collector
powers matter synthisiser
(for crafting see pictures)

hidden matter dust is smelted into hidden matter ingots
use 2 ingots and a diamond to create the hidden sword
does 23 damage.

magmatic extractor now fills buckets
sydium lava explodes when you try and place it.

====================
0.6.1 Update
====================

new ore - redstone infused platinum Ore
needs to be smelted to get ingots
pulverized / macerated to get dust to melt into ingots

redstone infused platinum ingot can be made into block
the block is very explosive resistant and very hard/long to mine.

new machine - forge
used to mix metal dusts
Thermal Expansion smelter can be used

First start to the advanced atomics has been added
-the atomics book
-glass lens
-scientists desk
-Derelict science lab
-pressurised steam furnace

dont have uses yet

atomics book can be crafted using a book and pewter ingot

glass lens has no use but can be crafted using 3 glass block in a vertical line

scientist desk currently has no use
the only way to get one is to find it a derelic science lab

derelic science lab is found on the serface of the overworld, they are quite common.

new multiblock pressurised steam boiler
built 3X3X3 and hollow in the middle
is made from redstone infused platinum.

new plant added - fibre plant

when fully grown and brocken drops sticky string
sticky string can be made into string or nano fibre sheeting

nano fibre sheeting will be made into nano block in a pressurised steam furnace

nano tech blocks are explosive resistant and have to be brocked 2/3 times be for
they drop
nano tech blocks drop 4 nano fibre sheets on breaking.
